    "In this study , we have examined promoter - lac fusions in strains that were argP or argP **or that were carrying dominant argP mutations in order to identify several new genes that are ArgP - regulated in vivo , including lysP , lysC , lysA , dapD , and asd ( in addition to argO , dapB** , and gdhA ) . \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together , our results argue that residues Thr158 , Pro160 , Gln164 and Lys166 of CRP **participate in transcription activation at the melAB promoter : these residues identify a surface of CRP that overlaps with AR** 1 ( Figure 4 ) . \n",
    "\n",
    "The NarL and Nar **P proteins compete for the 44 . 5 binding site ; binding of NarP further induces aeg - 46 . 5 operon expression , whereas binding of NarL has no significant effect on the basal** anaerobic ( Fnr - dependent ) level of expression . \n",
    "\n",
    "The extent of oligomerization of DnaA protein **appeared to be proportional to the inhibition of RNA polymerase binding to the promoters and the inhibition of transcription from the promoter** s . \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment we do not know how NagC activate **s the fimB promoter , but two** general scenarios seem most plausible . \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether ArgP **directly regulates lysP transcription , we tested binding of ArgP to the lysP** promoter / control region . \n",
    "\n",
    "We investigated whether DnaA protein and RNA **polymerase can coexist at the dnaA promoter by gel - shift and footprinting analyses and whether a direct protein - protein interaction between DnaA protein and RNA polymerase is the mechanism of** inhibition of transcription . \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is no simple rationale for why the yeaR and ogt promoter **s are also repressed by Fis , we suggest that rapidly growing cells may opt out of certain stress responses , and we speculate that RNS may** be a small risk in these conditions compared with other stresses . \n",
    "\n",
    "We assayed this library of alanine substitutions in 70 at two RhaR **- activated single - copy translational fusions , ( rhaS - lacZ ) 216 and ( rhaS - lac** Z ) 92 . \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence , Fis protein **is a major factor responsible for catabolite repression at the nrf promoter , and Fis can override activation by FNR and Nar** L or NarP . \n",
    "\n",
    "Since only the NarP protein **can activate aeg - 46 . 5 operon expression ( again , presumably by interacting with RNA polymerase ) , the competition from NarL for the binding sites would lead to an antagonization** of NarP activation . \n",
    "\n",
    "Concluding remarks The hcp gene **has been shown to be regulated by FNR , NarL and Nar** P proteins . \n",
    "\n",
    "Although DnaA protein **, at concentrations of 75 ng and greater , reduced transcription from rpmH promoter 1P , repression was preferential for the dnaA** promoters . \n",
    "\n",
    "Two other regulators , OmpR and CpxR **, activate nanC expression , although a direct control has** not been proven . \n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that the three central operators , galOE2 , OE3 and **OE4 , which have higher affinity for GalS than GalR , all have A / T at positions 8 of the operators ( Fig . 1B ) which is also the case for the mglB and galS operators (** Weickert and Adhya , 1993a , b ) which are preferentially regulated by GalS . \n",
    "\n",
    "Among functions that could contribute to cellular resistance to environmental agents , Rob enhance **s expression of mdlA , which encodes a multiple - drug - resistance - like ATP - binding component of a transport system ( 3 ) , and strongly enhances expression of micF , the antisense RNA that downregulates the outer** membrane porin OmpF . \n",
    "\n",
    "Other unknowns are how OmpR activates micF **transcription while binding at far upstream sequences , i . e . in the - 156 to - 216 region ( Figure** 4 ( a ) ) . \n",
    "\n",
    "MarA upregu **lates expression of nfnB Both oxygen - insensitive nitroreductases nfsA and nfnB were shown to be upregulated by constitutive expression of Mar** A from plasmid pAS10 ( Barbosa and Levy , 2000 ) . \n",
    "\n",
    "Samples were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel , run , and analyzed by autoradiography . gave a single retarded band of mobility similar to that observed with purified His 6 - ArgP protein **, whereas crude extracts devoid of ArgP gave no retarded band ( Fig . 3B ; see also Fig . 5A ) , indicating that no protein other than Arg** P is able to bind significantly to the dapB promoter region . \n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism of IciA protein **stimulation of transcription from dnaA promoter 1P in the presence of inhibitory amounts of DnaA** protein was examined . "
