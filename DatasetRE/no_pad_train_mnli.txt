Based on results from site - directed mutagenesis of the multiple Entity1 - binding motifs	 in Lrp - binding motifs , we assume that the organization ( proximity , number , and orientation ) of P fimA and their cooperative interaction with P Entity2 play a crucial role for on / off switching of the Lrp - binding motifs expression . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

In addition , we found that a single point mutation at leucine 289 in the C - terminal domain of the subunit of RNA polymerase leads to very low levels of Entity2	 : : Tn5lacZY expression , suggesting that Entity1 activates transcription of HilD by contacting and recruiting hilA to the hilA . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

Interestingly , work by others accomplished concurrently with our studies also showed that Entity2	 was regulated by Entity1 - PhoP and that the PhoQ mediates interaction of the PhoQ - pmrD gene product system with the pmrD gene product - PhoP system , as PhoP - regulated genes are not expressed in a PhoQ grown under PhoQ - PmrA - inducing conditions ( low magnesium ) ( 14 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
InvF and HilA are transcriptional regulators of SPI - 1 genes that are encoded within SPI - 1 ; Entity2	 itself is regulated by several factors , including Entity1 - PhoP , PhoQ , PhoQ , and SirA ( 35 , 20 , 37 , 44 , 66 , 72 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

It has been previously demonstrated that Entity2	 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the extracellular Mg 2 - responsive Entity1 / PhoP two - component system ( 13 , 39 ) and posttranscriptionally by an intracellular PhoQ - sensitive PhoQ that governs the extent of transcript elongation and stability ( 9 , 40 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
It has been reported that expression of Entity2	 is regulated at the transcriptional and post - transcriptional level by several factors including Entity1 , Fur and the sRNAs NsrR and NsrR ( Mass & amp ; Gottesman , 2002 ; Durand & amp ; Storz , 2010 ; Niederhoffer et al . , 1990 ; Partridge et al . , 2009 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

It is interesting that when site 2 in the Entity2 promoter	 is changed to a consensus Entity1 - binding site , MetR - binding site - metE expression is not only independent of a functional site 1 but also essentially independent of the coactivator homocysteine both in vivo ( Tables 1 and 3 ) and in vitro ( Fig . 4 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
It is noteworthy that a different regulation pattern was observed when the findings were compared to the findings for ugd ; the pag genes Entity2	 and pgbP are modulated negatively by the Entity1 protein in an RcsB protein - independent manner . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

It is shown that when the 5 0 LR is located in its native chromosomal location , it appears to have an additional regulatory function because the C98T substitution in the 5 0 LR unexpectedly led to constitutive Entity2	 transcription even in high Mg 2 ( OConnor et al , 2009 ) , in which the transcription initiation is supposed to be repressed by the Entity1 / PhoP system . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O 0

It should be mentioned that we found Entity2	 , spvA , and bapA transcriptional levels to be repressed in a strain expressing Entity1 from RstA , while they were unaltered in a pRtsA , compared to a wild - type background under the growth conditions tested ( Fig . 1 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

This conclusion is based on the following findings : ( i ) the concerted transcriptional regulation of 25 Entity1	 - activated genes by the PhoP levels in the growth media ; ( ii ) the identification of the Mg 2 Mg 2 and Mg 2 transporter genes as Mg 2 transporter genes regulated ; ( iii ) and the requirement for eight mgtA - activated Entity2 for growth in low - Mg mgtCB media . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
This could reflect that the Entity2	 and yrbL promoters are directly repressed by the response regulator Entity1 , which is activated post - translationally by the PmrA PhoP - dependent ( Kato et al . , 2003 ; Zwir et al . , 2005 ; Harari et al . , 2010 ) . 	0 O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

This fact , in conjunction with earlier findings indicating that the Entity2 gene	 is negatively autoregulated ( 25 ) , led us to question whether or not a single Entity1 - mediated event involving binding of the MetR to the MetR protein - MetR protein DNA affects both the activation of the metE metR control and the negative autoregulation of the metE metR control . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

This raised the possibility that Entity1	 may regulate PhoP transcription directly ; and if that were to be the case , amgR was likely to bind to the Entity2 with less affinity than to the PhoP , which has a complete PhoP box with excellent match to the amgR promoter ( Zwir et al . , 2005 ) . 	0 O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

Thus , STM1862 ( pagO ) and Entity2	 could be assigned to the category of genes repressed by Entity1 : their log 2 ratios in the comparison of the RcsB with the wild type were 2 . 96 / 1 . 69 and 2 . 4 / 1 . 8 , respectively . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , although the maximum Entity2 mRNA	 levels are similar for wild - type and fis cells at 120 min after subculturing in LB medium , the absence of Entity1 seems to affect the temporal regulation pattern of the Fis . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , although there are subtle differences , the Entity2	 and sit promoters are regulated similarly by Entity1 and Fur in response to Fe and Mn . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

Thus , depending on the environmental niche and spatiotemporal stage of infection , the Spi1 regulator Entity1	 could activate HilD transcription through direct binding to the flhDC or repress Entity2 transcription via activation of flhDC promoter . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , depending on the environmental niche and spatiotemporal stage of infection , the Spi1 regulator HilD could activate Entity2	 transcription through direct binding to the flhDC promoter or repress flhDC transcription via activation of Entity1 . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 0 
Thus , even though the Entity1 - activated	 PhoP - activated and mgtA are bound by the Entity2 at the same time and transcription of the phoP promoters happens concurrently with that of the phoP promoters 17 PhoP protein , production of the PhoP protein takes place 4 h later than that of the mgtA leader sequence ( Fig mgtA leader sequence ( 17 phoP gene ( . 606 NOTES J . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , even though the Entity1 - activated	 PhoP - activated and mgtA are bound by the mgtA at the same time and transcription of the phoP promoters happens concurrently with that of the Entity2 promoters 17 PhoP protein , production of the PhoP protein takes place 4 h later than that of the mgtA leader sequence ( Fig mgtA leader sequence ( 17 phoP gene ( . 606 NOTES J . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , if the abilities of these proteins to induce Entity2	 and hilA are compared , it becomes apparent that Entity1 and RtsA are better able to induce expression of HilD than HilD is ( Table 2 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , if the abilities of these proteins to induce Entity2	 and hilA are compared , it becomes apparent that RtsA and Entity1 are better able to induce expression of HilD than dsbA is ( Table 2 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , if the abilities of these proteins to induce Entity2	 and hilA are compared , it becomes apparent that RtsA and HilD are better able to induce expression of dsbA than Entity1 is ( Table 2 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , in agreement with the prediction of the Entity1	 binding IHF in site but not in site , these results indicate that csrB is required for the expression of Entity2 but not of csrC . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , it is unclear whether induction of the expression of Entity2	 and mgtCB in a corA mutant strain is mediated by Entity1 / PhoP or another mechanism . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , it is unclear whether induction of the expression of mgtA and Entity2	 in a corA mutant strain is mediated by Entity1 / PhoP or another mechanism . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , residual Entity1	 - mediated activation of the MetR - metE fusion in this lysogen is probably due to Entity2 bound exclusively at the wild - type site 2 . 	0 O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , the ability of HC to regulate Entity2 - lacZ	 expression does not appear to be strongly dependent either on the efficiency with which Entity1 binds to the MetR - metH control region or on the efficiency with which already bound metH can activate lacZ - lacZ expression . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , the decreased expression of Entity2	 and sopB ( sigD ) could be due to decreased levels of Entity1 . 	0 O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 0 
Thus , the decreased expression of sopA and Entity2	 ( sigD ) could be due to decreased levels of Entity1 . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 0 
Thus , the phage presumably evolved to regulate the acquired Entity2 gene	 via Entity1 while maintaining the amino acid sequence critical for L function . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , to distinguish whether factors regulate Entity2	 via Entity1 , or independently of HilD , we placed HilD expression under the control of a HilD - inducible promoter ( rtsA ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , under Entity1	 active conditions ( left panel ) , Fur is repressed by hns thereby blocking Entity2 repression of Fur and the Fur ( signified by the circle with an X ) . 	0 O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , under this 2 . 5 - fold constraint , the microarray data did not identify Entity2	 as differentially regulated by Entity1 . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 0 
Thus , we reasoned that Entity2	 expression might respond not only to Mg 2 in a Entity1 PhoP - dependent manner but also to the activated state of the PhoQ system . 	0 O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , we showed that Entity1	 negatively regulates the expression of Fur and that the positive effect of hns on the expression of Entity2 is dependent on an upstream sequence that contained the putative Fur in Fur . 	0 O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Thus , we tested the possibility of Entity1	 regulating PhoP transcription using isogenic wild - type and iraP strains deleted for the Entity2 and harboring a chromosomal phoP transcriptional fusion to the phoP . 	0 O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
To assess its role in the Entity1	 - mediated regulation of Fur we modified the putative nrdHIEF box by sitespecific mutagenesis ( Figure 5A ) and monitored the Entity2 levels of the Fur - Fur reporter fusion . 	0 O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
To assess the contribution of Entity1	 to osmolarity dependent repression of RcsB transcription in the absence of flhC activity of a Entity2 : : TviA , - galactosidase was compared to a TviA , - galactosidase : : viaB flhC ( Fig viaB flhC and B ) . 	0 O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
To compare the level of expression stimulated by DctD250 to the level that is seen under physiological conditions that activate the promoterassociated bEBP , lacZ expression from the Entity2 promoter	 was assayed in the WT strain in nitrogen - limiting medium , which activates Entity1 . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 0 
To confirm that the increase in Entity2	 transcription in the fis mutant was due to the absence of Entity1 , the exponential - phase activity of Fis was measured in wild - type and P rpoS - lac [ op ] backgrounds harboring either the single - copy P rpoS - lac [ op ] plasmid , fis mutant , or the empty vector control pGS349 ( 32 , 71 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
To confirm the regulatory role of Entity1	 in the regulation of Fur in anaerobically cultured cells , we assessed the impact of a deletion in fur on the expression of a hilA - Entity2 reporter . 	0 O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O 0 
To define the region that is required for Entity1	 - dependent induction in the Rob , we initially took mgtA promoter - As shown in Fig . 1A , and in contrast to Entity2 promoter , neither advan nor advan overexpression upregulated Rob transcription . 	0 O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0
