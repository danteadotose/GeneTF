Further studies showed that the Entity2 promoter	 is a typical Class II Entity1dependent promoter , activated by a single dimer of Class II CRPdependent promoter , that binds to a 22 bp DNA site centred at position 241 . 5 with respect to the transcription start point ( reviewed by Busby and Ebright , 1997 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel 0

Given that cyclic AMP receptor protein ( Entity1	 ) , the second activator required for full CRP expression , cannot activate rhaBAD expression in a rhaS strain , it was of interest to test whether Entity2 could activate transcription in combination with rhaBAD . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
Given that the activation by full - length , chromosomally expressed RhaS at rhaBAD is approximately 33 - fold higher than that of chromosomally expressed Entity1	 at RhaR , comparable efficiencies of activation by the CTDs to their full - length counterparts would have resulted in rhaSR - Entity2 activating His 6 - RhaR by approximately 30 - fold . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

However , the Entity2	 control region has a very different architecture , with an Fnr - binding site centered at position 64 . 5 and activation by Entity1 being mediated by a binding site downstream , at position 44 . 5 ( Fig . 1 ) . 	0 O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

However , the inactivation of Entity1	 ( DcuS ) led to a decrease of IMW553 - IMW553 expression by a factor of citC , which could be due to interaction between Entity2 and lacZ . 	0 O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O 0

In addition , the repression of Entity2	 translation by Entity1 induces premature ChiX - dependent transcription termination within the Rho , preventing expression of the Rho ( encoding a putative lipoprotein of unknown function ) located immediately downstream of chiP gene and normally cotranscribed with the latter ( Bossi et al . , 2012 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
In addition to the specific regulator , transcription from certain promoters regulated by members of this family requires other proteins for maximal activity ( e . g . , the Entity1	 in the CRP ) , or P rhaBAD promoter that act as negative regulators ( e . g . , P Entity2 promoter in the histone - like proteins - regulated histone - like proteins ) ( 52 , 124 , 242 ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

In order to simplify our analysis , we exploited an engineered derivative of the Entity2 promoter	 in which Entity1 binding to site 2 and site 2 ¢ , in the absence of MelR , is sufficient for transcription activation . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

In our previous work with the tri - alanine scanning library , we also determined that several members of the library reduced Entity1	 - dependent activation of transcription from the SoxS , as expected , because the class I fpr promoter of class I Entity2 promoter lies upstream of the 35 hexamer , which is therefore exposed and available for binding by 70 R4 . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 
In previous work , we found that NarL or Entity1	 activates the NarP by binding to a site centred at position - 69 . 5 and counteracting the repressive effects of nir promoter and Entity2 promoter . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O 0

In the case of Entity2	 , Entity1 mediates its transcriptional activation by ArgP , as well as its repression by Lys ( 7 , 26 , 32 , 37 ) ; the latter is achieved by a mechanism involving the active trapping at the Arg by Arg of argO promoter , which is then prevented from being released to engage in productive transcription ( 26 ) . 	0 O O O O O 0 0 0 0 I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0

There is no obvious effect of the Entity1 + 6 mutation	 on CAP + 6 mutation expression but this is presumably due to two opposing effects which are of similar magnitude : an 10 - to 15 - fold increase in nagE expression due to loss of repressor binding ( equivalent to that seen for the Entity2 fusion ) and a 10 - to 15 - fold decrease in nagE expression due to a lack of cAMP / nagE activation ( 5 ; see also below ) . 	0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0
