the results described above indicated that GeneReg	 binds the RegProtein regulatory region to mediate its nearly 35 - fold transcriptional activation and that the absence of such lysp regulatory region binding either in argp or upon lys supplementation in argp results in very low levels of argp mutants expression .

based on data from in vitro studies , celis suggested that wild - type GeneReg	 both represses its own transcription and activates that of RegProtein ; he also sought to explain the can r phenotype associated with the argk on the assumption that it is a loss - of - function ( that is , dominant - negative ) allele whose product is unable to efficiently activate the genes involved in arg uptake , including argp d mutation .

furthermore , even the finding of celis ( 12 ) that RegProtein	 is a target for transcriptional activation by argp may need to be reexamined , given that ( i ) there is a discrepancy between the expected GeneReg transcript size ( approximately 310 bases ) determined from the promoter mapping data published by celis et al . in an earlier paper ( 13 ) and that reported by him ( 215 bases ) for argk runoff activation experiments ( 12 ) and ( ii ) the promoter ( for argk runoff ) mapped by his group ( 13 ) is within the argp per the 	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the model proposed by celis ( 11 , 12 ) to explain the can r phenotype of an GeneReg d mutant	 assumed ( i ) that the mutation represents a loss - of - function ( that is , dominant - negative ) allele of argp and ( ii ) that wild - type argp is a transcriptional activator of RegProtein , whose product in turn acts to enhance arg uptake through two different transport systems .

the GeneReg protein	 enhances the expression of the RegProtein gene to test the biological activity of the argk gene on the argp protein ine transport system , the amounts of mrna synthesized by a 502 bp k argp protein -v dna fragment containing the n terminus and the control region of the argin was investigated .

expression of the e coli .

more recently , GeneReg	 was shown to bind to an approximately 60 - bp - long sequence partially overlapping the RegProtein promoter ( fig . 1 ; laishram and gowrishankar , © 2009 the authors journal compilation © 2009 blackwell publishing ltd , molecular microbiology , 74 , 1513 – 152 argo promoter p and 6lr of argo transcription 151 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

in the case of RegProtein	 , argp mediates its transcriptional activation by GeneReg , as well as its repression by lys ( 7 , 26 , 32 , 37 ) ; the latter is achieved by a mechanism involving the active trapping at the arg by arg of argo promoter , which is then prevented from being released to engage in productive transcription ( 26 ) .

the GeneReg site	 - binding for RegProtein extends up to nucleotide 20 and thereby overlaps the 35 promoter motif , whereas the argo - binding site for argp extends up to position 47 , which is upstream of the 35 promoter site ( fig . 2 ) .

in this study , we have examined promoter - lac fusions in strains that were GeneReg	 or argp or that were carrying dominant argp mutations in order to identify several new genes that are argp - regulated in vivo , including lysp , lysc , lysa , dapd , and asd ( in addition to RegProtein , argo , and dapb ) .

considering the in vivo and in vitro data presented in this work , the mechanism by which GeneReg	 regulates RegProtein transcription ( 24 ) , and the known capacity of argo to alter the shape of the dna by inducing bending and wrapping ( 57 ) , a model for lrp regulation in which binding of lrp to the lysp may favor and / or stabilize the lysp - lrp - dna complexes or introduce dna conformational changes is conceivable .

one possibility for this result is that in the absence of arca , arcb might phosphorylate ( i . e arcb - ompr , 43	 ) one or more response regulators , either unspecifically or due to crosstalk , which could bind to the promoter region and therefore prevent binding of positive regulators like GeneReg , which has been demonstrated to regulate RegProtein	 ) one or more response regulators , either unspecifically or due to crosstalk , which could bind to the promoter region and therefore prevent binding of positive regulators like GeneReg , which has been demonstrated to regulate RegProtein	 ) one or more response regulators , either unspecifically or due to crosstalk , which could bind to the promoter region and therefore prevent binding of positive regulators like GeneReg , which has been demonstrated to regulate RegProtein and is up - regulated in response to hocl 20 , 44 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

to determine whether GeneReg	 directly regulates RegProtein transcription , we tested binding of lysp to the argp / control region . 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

to evaluate whether GeneReg	 was involved in the transcriptional regulation of RegProtein , a nonfunctional lysp ( argp allele : ) was transduced into strain mg - lr carrying the chromosomal argp allele argp : cam r : argp : cam r .

to confirm the role of GeneReg	 in the regulation of RegProtein transcription , the lysp was cloned into plasmid pbad24 under the control of the arabinose - inducible ( 18 ) . 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

so far , our results demonstrate that GeneReg	 directly binds to the RegProtein promoter / control region and that the t - n 11 - a sequence located close to the lysp promoter binding is important for binding and crucial for rna polymerase site transcription .

our conclusion runs contrary to that of han et al .

therefore , a straightforward interpretation of our results , as further discussed below , is that ( i ) GeneReg	 is a transcriptional activator of RegProtein , ( ii ) ygga ’ s activator function is enhanced by arg and inhibited by lys , and ( iii argp gga encodes argp arg ( ) y can ) exporter in e . coli 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

johnson and robert f . schleif * department of biology , johns hopkins university , baltimore , maryland 21218 received 20 september 1999 / accepted 12 january 2000 full activation of transcription of the RegProtein promoter	 , p f gh , requires both the catabolite activator protein ( cap ) and GeneReg .

why , then , is GeneReg	 sufficient to activate the RegProtein operon but not gal operon ? 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O

this was indeed suggested by detiollaz et al . ( 49 ) on the basis that ihf sites replacing GeneReg	 sites allowed activation of the RegProtein promoter , albeit less than with malt promoter . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 

the simultaneous binding of repressor and activator type proteins to RegProtein dna	 implies two corollaries : ( 1 ) nagc does not repress by competition with cap and ( 2 ) GeneReg does not activate by displacing cap .

the greater expression of RegProtein	 in the cap + 6 context than in the GeneReg – 6 case correlates with the fact that activation cap cap is still possible with cap cap + 6 mutation ( the cap site is still at – 71 . 5 ) but by at cap – 6 , where the cap site is now located at – 66 . 5 , i . e . on the other side of the by with polymer ( 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

despite the fact that the residual activity of the GeneReg pc proteins	 at the two promoters is different in the induced and uninduced conditions , there is a clear qualitative difference in the response of nage and RegProtein caps to the mutant : 50 – 100 % activation nagb caps gb and maximally 20 % activation at na ge 	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

there is no obvious effect of the GeneReg + 6 mutation	 on RegProtein expression but this is presumably due to two opposing effects which are of similar magnitude : an 10 - to 15 - fold increase in nage expression due to loss of nage ress nage binding ( equivalent to that seen for the rep ) and a 10 - to 15 - fold decrease in rep expression due to a lack of or / activation ( 5 ; see also below ) .

repression by nagc and GeneReg	 in vivo a plasmid overexpressing chbr produces very strong repression of the RegProtein – lacz fusion in a wild - type strain ( 37 - fold ) , whereas a plasmid overex chbb – lac gc produces less than twofold repression ( table 5 ) 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

first , expression of the inner membrane transporter RegProtein	 is activated directly by the chbr protein , which allows entry of GeneReg protein and generation of the specific chb - 6p - inducing signal ( by action of chb - 6p enzyme ; verma and mahadevan , 2012 ) .

in addition , the repression of RegProtein	 translation by chix induces premature GeneReg - dependent transcription termination within the rho , preventing expression of the rho gene ( encoding a putative lipoprotein of unknown function ) located immediately downstream of chip gene and normally cotranscribed with the latter ( bossi et al . , 2012 ) .

as the chb transcript accumulates , GeneReg	 pairing with the intercistronic chbbc mrna elicits the degradation of the sr na resulting in the progressive relief of RegProtein repression ( figueroa - bossi et al . , 2009 ; overgaard et al . , 2009 ) .

in conclusion , melr and GeneReg	 bind to the RegProtein promoter co - operatively to adjacent sites in order to activate transcription in a co - dependent manner . 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the fact that the same level of GeneReg	 - dependent transcription activation is seen in vitro with both rnap preparations argues that crp activates transcription at the RegProtein promoter independently of melab promoter .

note that the magnitude of the effect of GeneReg	 on activation of the RegProtein promoter in the in vitro transcription experiment ( fig . 2b ) is less than might have been expected from the footprinting and in vivo experiments ( fig . 4 and table 1 ) .

substitutions within GeneReg	 that affect transcription activation at the RegProtein promoter to identify the residues of melab promoter that are important in transcription activation at the crp promoter , a library of randomly mutated crp was created using error - prone pcr .

taken together , our results argue that residues thr158 , pro160 , gln164 and lys166 of GeneReg	 participate in transcription activation at the RegProtein promoter : these residues identify a surface of melab promoter that overlaps with crp ( figure 4 ) .

thus , we have investigated the involvement of actd in GeneReg	 - dependent activation at the RegProtein promoter by using a preparation of melab promoter , reconstituted with truncated a subunits that lack the c - terminal 73 residues .

optimal expression of the RegProtein promoter	 requires sites 1 0 , site 1 , site 2 and site 2 0 ; crp acts as a ` bridge ' between GeneReg bound at sites 1 0 and 1 and at sites 2 and 2 0 , increasing expression from the melr .

melr is a member of the arac - xyls family of bacterial gene regulatory proteins ( 6 ) and our previous studies have shown that melr , together with the cyclic amp receptor protein , GeneReg	 , regulates expression of the RegProtein operon that encodes products essential for melibiose metabolism ( 7 ) .

furthermore , as nagc binding to o nc1 prevents GeneReg	 - dependent activation of RegProtein ( condemine et al . , 2005 ) , this study should enhance our understanding of the regulation of this gene as well .

during the course of our studies on GeneReg	 activation of the RegProtein operon , we compared expression from various rhabad operon ( fig . 1 ) in rhabad promoter fusions and rhabad promoter fusions strain backgrounds .

two gels were prepared , with identical culture samples on each gel , and each blot was probed with the primary antibody corresponding to the purified protein samples loaded , as indicated to the right . - s , anti - rhas antibody - ; - r , anti rhar antibody . allow GeneReg	 to contribute to RegProtein activation .

finally , at the ( rhab - lacz ) 110 fusion , which contains the GeneReg site	 required for full RegProtein activation as well as the full rhabad binding , there was a twofold contribution to activation by rhas site when in combination with rhas site and a fivefold contribution to activation4990 wickstrum et al .

the threefold contribution to activation by GeneReg	 in this experiment is very similar to the twofold contribution found in the above in vivo experiment ( table 3 ) , confirming that rhas - ctd is sufficient to allow at least partial crp activation of RegProtein expression .

given that cyclic amp receptor protein ( GeneReg	 ) , the second activator required for full RegProtein expression , cannot activate rhabad expression in a rhabad strain , it was of interest to test whether rhabad could activate transcription in combination with rhas .

an additional 50 - fold activation of RegProtein	 expression occurs when crp occupies its binding site centered at 92 . 5 , which places GeneReg adjacent to crp ) . 	O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O 

to address the mechanisms of activation by GeneReg	 and the rna polymerase - subunit c - terminal domain ( - ctd ) at RegProtein , we tested the effects of alanine substitutions in rhasr activating regions 1 and 2 , overexpression of a truncated version of ( - 235 ) , and alanine substitutions throughout - ctd .

we hypothesize that GeneReg	 binding to some or all of these sites may influence transcription activation at RegProtein . 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

these results suggest that the dna region between 90 and 128 is important for activation at RegProtein	 and that putative crp sites 2 , 3 , and / or 4 may be functional GeneReg sites .

deletion of GeneReg	 ( table 5 ) resulted in a level of expression from each fusion that was similar to the expression from ( rhas - lacz ) 90 in the crp strain background , supporting our hypothesis that full RegProtein activation requires rhasr .

we assayed the plasmid - borne lacz fusions carrying these mutations to determine whether either of these two GeneReg sites	 was required for RegProtein activation . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

this suggests that GeneReg	 site 3 is responsible for at least part of the crp activation of RegProtein expression 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

taken together , our results suggest that GeneReg	 site 3 is the major site required for crp activation of RegProtein expression . 	O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

although there are many moderate to weak matches to the consensus GeneReg binding site	 - sequence in the RegProtein - rhasr region , three of these , sites 2 through 4 , seemed most likely to directly influence rhabad intergenic activation . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

it is unlikely that GeneReg	 binding to site 4 contributes directly to an increase in RegProtein expression , since transcription activation by rhasr requires that its binding site be on the same face of the dna as the promoter ( 6 ) . 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

mechanism of activation by GeneReg	 at RegProtein . 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

clearly there is a component ( 13 - to 20 - fold ) to the activation by GeneReg	 at RegProtein that is independent of both - ctd and rhasr and hence does not function by the same mechanism used at simple rhar - dependent promoters , nor does it function through cooperative binding with rhar . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

this component of GeneReg	 activation at RegProtein could account for the majority of the rhasr activation in a wild - type context and may involve a mechanism , such as dna bending , that can act from a distance . 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the GeneReg site	 required for full activation at RegProtein is located upstream but not adjacent to the rhasr and is centered at 111 . 5 ( fig . 1 ) ( 17 ) . 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

since we now had evidence that GeneReg	 was a direct activator of RegProtein expression , we wished to determine whether rhasr and / or ar1 of ar1 were necessary for this activation . 	O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

to explore the origin of the indirect effect , we tested whether GeneReg	 was involved in regulation of RegProtein expression . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

we found that GeneReg	 alone was not capable of activating RegProtein expression , similar to previous findings in vivo , and that rhabad - his 6 alone substantially activated his 6 expression ( fig . 6 ) .

these results appear to be consistent with those from the experiments with lacz operon fusion s , as shown in table 4 , and it is likely that the binding of GeneReg	 to a single element ( the r1 sequence ) is capable of decreasing the transcription of the RegProtein genes .

to investigate how GeneReg	 activates RegProtein expression further , the fimb binding mutation described above was combined with those in ihf site nc1 , o nc2 and ihf site alone , and o nc1 o in combination , and the expression of the o z chimera was measured ( fig . 6 ) 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

because previous studies have shown that the GeneReg sites	 - binding of two other repressed promoters ( RegProtein and hdea ) lie in a backward orientation ( 20 ) and either partially or completely overlap the - 35 hexamer , we examined whether the putative pura might be in a similar configuration and position .

unlike most other promoters , RegProtein	 seemed to require additional sequence upstream of the – 76 to – 57 site for maximum activation by mara , by GeneReg 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O 

we previously demonstrated that in vitro transcriptional activation by GeneReg	 at the RegProtein promoter requires interaction with the carboxy - terminal domain of the a subunit of zwf promoter ) and inferred that rna polymerase ( 21 activates the rna polymerase ( 21 by enhancing the binding of mara .

the rob homo logs GeneReg	 and soxs can activate transcription of a broad range of genes in vivo ( reviewed in references 2 and 14 ) , including soda , fumc , micf , RegProtein , and zwf , suggesting broadly overlapping activities of these three regulators .

like male - soxs , GeneReg	 ( i ) activated the transcription of RegProtein , zwf , fpr , fpr , fumc , and fumc ; ( ii ) required a 21 - bp " soxbox " sequence to activate micf transcription ; and ( iii ) was " ambidextrous , " i . e . , required the c - terminal domain of the micf subunit of nfo for activation of nfo but not soda or soda .

recently , we demonstrated that activation of in vitro RegProtein	 transcription by male - soxs ( 18 ) , and by mara as well ( 19 ) , requires this same dna binding element and that this GeneReg / mar can bring in vitro soxboxbox transcription under control of these two activators ( 18 , 19 ) .

since we have shown previously that male - soxs and GeneReg	 are sufficient for the in vitro transcriptional activation of the RegProtein , zwf , fpr , fpr , fumc , and fumc ( i . e . , additional factors are not required ) ( 18 , 19 ) , we conducted similar studies with purified micf .

despite overlapping regulation by soxs , GeneReg	 , and rob , the three systems exhibit differential control in terms of both the strength of their effects on individual genes and activation of some promoters uniquely ( e . g . , RegProtein by zwf or soxs but not by soxs ) .

we surmise , from the distance of this marbox ( centered at - 61 . 5 ) to the putative - 35 transcriptional signal ( 17 , 18 ) , that activation of mar by GeneReg	 requires interaction with the carboxy - terminal domain of the alpha subunit of rna polymerase , i . e . , that mara is a class i activator ( 16 ) of mar as it is for RegProtein .

in a similar experiment with a rob + mar strain , excess GeneReg	 stimulated RegProtein type transcription of a wild - mar type : by only 1 . 6 - fold ( 27 ) . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

we previously demonstrated that in vitro transcriptional activation by GeneReg	 at the zwf promoter requires interaction with the carboxy - terminal domain of the a subunit of rna polymerase ( 21 ) and inferred that mara activates the RegProtein promoter by enhancing the binding of mar promoter .

for example , GeneReg	 binds tightly to the RegProtein promoter in vitro yet stimulates transcription by only ~ 3 - fold ; no significant binding to marrab promoter can be demonstrated by gel shift experiments , yet transcription is stimulated & gt ; 5 - fold .

thus , the RegProtein operon	 has the remarkable property that its first gene product , marr , represses its transcription whereas the second gene product , GeneReg , stimulates its transcription .

expression of the operon , consisting of GeneReg	 , RegProtein , and mara , is normally repressed by marb but can be induced by diverse compounds such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol , menadione , and salicylates ( 6 , 16 , 28 ) . 	O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

RegProtein	 expression is repressed by marr and is derepressed by the interaction of GeneReg with various phenolic compounds such as salicylate . 	O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O 

expression of the operon , consisting of GeneReg	 , mara , and RegProtein , is normally repressed by marb but can be induced by diverse compounds such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol , menadione , and salicylates ( 6 , 16 , 28 ) . 	O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , transcription of the RegProtein operon	 is autorepressed by GeneRegab operon and autoactivated by marr at a site that also can be activated by marr . 	O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel 

to determine whether site ii is essential for repression by GeneReg	 , maro 133 , a mutant deleted for the 20 bp immediately preceding marr ( pos . 1425 - 1444 ) but wild - type for RegProtein ( unpublished data ) , was studied .

to evaluate the role of the two GeneReg sites	 binding in the repression of RegProtein operon transcription ( fig . 1a ; cohen et al . , 1993a ; martin and rosner , 1995 ) , fusions of the marrab operon to marrab regulatory region were constructed and integrated in the chromosome as single - copy ? rs45 lysogens ( simons et al . , 1987 ) .

the GeneReg gene	 encodes a repressor protein that binds to maro and represses transcription of RegProtein . 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

GeneReg	 activates expression of the RegProtein and mela , encoding an melb genes and a melb genes , respectively . 	O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

optimal repression requires RegProtein	 binding to a site that overlaps the GeneReg and to upstream sites . 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O 

GeneReg	 and crp interact at the RegProtein promoter to activate transcription , but this interaction can be exploited to repress transcription ( figure 3 ) . 	O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

in conclusion , GeneReg	 and crp bind to the RegProtein promoter co - operatively to adjacent sites in order to activate transcription in a co - dependent manner . 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

recent studies ( 11 ) have shown that the occupation of site 2 by GeneReg	 is the most crucial for the activation of the RegProtein promoter , but that , of the four target sites , site 2 binds melab promoter most weakly .

the resulting recombinant plasmids were used to monitor GeneReg	 - dependent activation at the RegProtein promoter ; i . e . transcripts initiating at the melab promoter run to the melab promoter op terminator and give discrete transcripts that are easy to detect by gel electrophoresis .

this shows that we had failed to identify GeneReg	 mutants with improved specificity for the changed kk 43 3 melr - binding sequences type ; mutants with specificity for the kk433 sequence would have given lower levels of activation with the wild - RegProtein promoter .

in subsequent work ( williams et al . , 1994 ) , we were able to prove that GeneReg	 binding to both these sites ( called site 1 and site 2 ; see fig . 1a ) is necessary for melibiose - dependent activation of the RegProtein promoter in vivo .

melrdependent activation of the RegProtein promoter	 requires the binding of melr subunits to four 18 bp sites and the binding of a single GeneReg subunitsr to a low - affinity target sequence ( belyaeva et al . , 2000 ; wade et al . , 2001 ; see fig . 1a ) .

GeneReg	 is a member of the arac - xyls family of bacterial gene regulatory proteins ( 6 ) and our previous studies have shown that melr , together with the cyclic amp receptor protein , crp , regulates expression of the RegProtein operon that encodes products essential for melibiose metabolism ( 7 ) .

GeneReg	 stimulates transcription initiation at the RegProtein promoter by binding to four sites centered at positions 120 . 5 , 100 . 5 , 62 . 5 , and 42 . 5 upstream of the transcript start point .

in order to advance our understanding of the arac family , we have focussed on the e . coli RegProtein operon	 , which is regulated by melr , a close homologue of GeneReg . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O

thus , the RegProtein promoter	 is not efficiently repressed by GeneReg promoter , and melr is over - expressed . 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 

RegProtein	 carrying each of the single substitutions is less able to repress the GeneReg , while melr promoter carrying some combinations of substitutions is completely unable to repress the melr promoter .

we show that the RegProtein promoter	 is repressed by GeneReg promoter and that this autoregulation requires melr binding to site r . 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , the RegProtein promoter	 is not efficiently repressed by GeneReg promoter and melr is overexpressed . 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O 

the experiment illustrated in figure 2 shows that RegProtein - 1	 has little or no effect on the synthesis of rna but represses synthesis of the transcript from the GeneReg - 1 .

thus , melibiose toggles RegProtein	 between a state where it represses GeneReg and is unable to activate pmelr to a state where pmelr is derepressed and pmelab is activated . 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

hence , in this work , we used in vivo and in vitro methods to investigate the determinants needed for RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

to measure RegProtein	 - dependent repression of GeneReg activity , the melr promoter derivatives carrying the tb20 , tb22 , tb23 or tb10 fragments were transformed into wam1321 mel cells containing either melr promoter , encoding prw50r lac , or empty control vector , prw50r lac and pjw15 activities were measured .

in contrast , and in full agreement with the previous results of wade et al . ( 17 ) , the longer deletion in the tb 23 fragment , that removes RegProtein site 2	 binding , results in a sharp reduction in the repression of the GeneReg site 2 by melr promoter .

this change confers partial crp independence on the RegProtein promoter	 ( data not shown ) and also causes a small reduction in GeneReg promoter - dependent repression . 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O 

results illustrated in figure 5b show that the RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg in the tb210 fragment is unchanged in the tb211 and tb222 derivatives . 	O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , tb201 is a derivative of tb20 in which the dna site for crp located between RegProtein site	 1 other determinants for GeneReg site - dependent repression of the melr to investigate the effects of altering the spacing between melr and the upstream sites , derivatives of the tb22 fragment with 5 - or 10 - bp deletions , or with 5 - , 41 - or 91 - bp insertions were constructed ( see figure 6a and materials and methods section ) .

in our previous study ( 17 ) , we reported that repression of the RegProtein promoter	 by GeneReg promoter was unaffected by point mutations in either site 1 or site 1 0 . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in vitro studies of RegProtein	 binding at the GeneReg our results show that melr promoter - dependent repression of the melr promoter is contingent on melr binding to site r and is somehow modulated by melr binding to upstream sites 2 , 1 and 1 0 .

our aim in this work was to ascertain if such a simple model applied to RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

we previously suggested that a RegProtein	 dimer simultaneously occupies site r and site 2 , creating a repression loop and the effects of different insertions and deletions on GeneReg - dependent repression of the melr ( figure 6 ) are consistent with this ( 17 ) .

these results argue that different conformational states of RegProtein	 are responsible for activation of the GeneReg and repression of the melab promoter . 	O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O 

activities were used to measure RegProtein	 - dependent activation of GeneReg and pmelab - dependent repression of pmelab . 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O 

with one exception , each of the different single RegProtein	 substitutions results in a small reduction in the GeneReg - dependent repression of melr . 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O 

we reasoned that the difference between the form of RegProtein	 unable to activate GeneReg but competent for repression of pmelab and the alternative form that can activate pmelab but is unable to repress pmelr might be , in part , due to subunitsubunit interactions . 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

since it is likely that RegProtein	 - GeneReg interactions are important for both activation of melr and repression of melr , we suppose that that differences recorded in table 5 are due to differences in these interactions .

however , cells that also contain pjw15 , encoding RegProtein	 , score clearly as GeneReg minus , due to the lac - dependent repression of the lac ( i . e . they give pale pink ± white colonies 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

we reasoned that RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg must be less efficient in these mutants . 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O 

from this , we conclude that the RegProtein binding site	 - r plays an essential role in GeneReg binding site - dependent repression of the melr . 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 

the figure also shows the measured amount of RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg on the melr promoter 8 melr promoter fragment carrying the different site r substitutions . 	O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

optimal RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg depends on upstream sequences transcription initiation of the melr promoter is dependent on the binding of melr promoter to a 22 bp dna site centered at position 241 . 5 , but sequences further upstream are not essential ( webster et al . , 1988 ) .

the results shown in fig . 4 indicate that , with the shorter kk101 fragment , repression of the RegProtein promoter	 by GeneReg promoter differs from the repression found with the longer kk81 fragment . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

we reasoned that some part of the melab promoter might be responsible for the high level of melrdependent repression of the RegProtein promoter	 seen with the GeneReg promoter fragment . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O 

results in fig . 5 show that RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg is little altered by the changes in site 1 ( kk81s3 ) or site 1 0 ( kk81s4 ) . 	O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , when RegProtein - binding site 2	 is altered in the GeneReg - binding site 28 kk fragment , the pattern of melrdependent repression of the kk is similar to that seen with the shorter 1 fragment ( fig . 4 ) .

however , the situation is not so simple , and , in the absence of melibiose , efficient repression requires dna sequences upstream of the RegProtein promoter	 ; in particular , GeneReg promoterding site 2 is required . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O 

together with the present results , this suggests a simple model ( illustrated in fig . 6 ) to explain how RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg is modulated by the elements at the upstream melr promoter .

model for RegProtein	 - dependent repression of the GeneReg . in the absence of melibiose , melr promoter subunits occupy site r and site 2 forming a repression loop . 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , binding of GeneReg	 to this area could serve to simultaneously repress both metr and RegProtein expression 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O 

first , when we replaced the knockout with a wild - type GeneReg gene	 expressed from a plasmid , thus increasing gene copy number , transcript and presumably repressor protein concentrations , there was a remarkable increase in the ability of metj to repress the RegProtein locus .

these latter results , together with the experiments described here showing that GeneReg	 binds to this region of dna , strongly suggest that the - 8 to + 27 region is involved in RegProtein repression .

thus , binding of GeneReg	 to this area could serve to simultaneously repress both RegProtein and metr expression 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O 

deletion of all of the GeneReg coding	 region and half of the intercistronic region ( p km jahn ) lowered the RegProtein expression , but the remaining activity was ' still subject to repression by chromosomal galk .

thus , the single chromosomal copy of GeneReg	 in jj100 produces enough product to cause about a 35 - fold repression of the multiple , plasmid - borne RegProtein promoters .

it appears that binding of the GeneReg gene product	 may prevent binding of rna polymerase to the RegProtein and metb and , under strongly repressing conditions , may also decrease the binding to the jl promoters .

the GeneReg gene product	 exists as a dimer with an mr of 24 , 000 and has been shown to bind specifically , in vitro , to the region of dna between metj and RegProtein and to the dna near the metbl , causing repression of all four genes ( 24 , 26 ) .

the metbl and RegProtein genes	 each had a single transcript which was repressed by metj , while the GeneReg had three transcripts , of which the first was strongly repressed by metj gene , the second was less strongly repressed , and the third was not repressed .

in the repressed strains , jj100 and its prcg 161 transformant , no RegProtein message	 was detectable , showing that transcription of both the chromosomal and plasmid - borne metf gene is blocked by the metj - GeneReg regulatory system 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O

our results confirm that RegProtein	 is autoregulated and demonstrate that much of the regulation is indeed at the level of transcription ( i . e . , repression of the GeneReg and jl ) .

the finding of only one GeneReg site	 binding suggests that the binding of metr to this region may be responsible for both the activation of expression of RegProtein as well as the autoregulation of mete ( 20 , 36 ) .

it should be noted ( lanes 1 - 4 ) that although plasmid prse562 directs the synthesis of the GeneReg protein	 there is still a large stimulation of RegProtein expression by added mete . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O 

the GeneReg gene	 , which activates mete and RegProtein , was only slightly derepressed 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O 

similar to the results of mete expression , GeneReg	 greatly stimulates the synthesis of RegProtein using plasmid pqn1011 as template ( lane 5 vs . lane 7 ) . 	O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the results of the present study extend these observations and show that the GeneReg protein	 also stimulates the in vitro expression of RegProtein and that both the meth and mete synthesized in vitro are enzymatically active .

however the much stronger repression of this fusion by overproduced GeneReg	 , compared with overproduced nagc , shows that the isolated RegProtein operator site has a higher affinity for nage operator site than mlc .

recent experiments on the RegProtein	 - regulated genes showed that although nagc binding to GeneReg could be detected in vitro , there was no or little regulation in vivo ( 6 , 17 , unpublished results ) .

many cel + strains carry mutations in GeneReg	 the nagc repressor that regulates the nag operon involved in n - acetylglucosamine metabolism was also shown to regulate the RegProtein operon ( plumbridge and pellegrini , 2004 ) .

we can deduce that cellobiose - 6p is capable of generating an inducing signal for chbr but not an inducing signal for GeneReg	 and that induction of both regulators is necessary for derepressed expression of the RegProtein operon .

repression by GeneReg	 and chbr in vivo a plasmid overexpressing chbr produces very strong repression of the RegProtein – lacz fusion in a wild - type strain ( 37 - fold ) , whereas a plasmid overex chbb – lac gc produces less than twofold repression ( table 5 ) 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

GeneReg	 is required for full repression of the RegProtein operon and it serves to limit induction when the supply of chitobiose is low . 	O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

GeneReg	 repression is critical in maintaining RegProtein mrna levels low enough , relative to chip mrna , to allow full silencing by this srna . 	O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

however , placing the nanr , ihf and GeneReg sites	 binding closer to the RegProtein promoter enhances the ability of the regulators to activate fimb promoter expression . 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , nanr and GeneReg	 appear to activate RegProtein expression independently 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

while the basis for this effect is uncertain , it is nevertheless evident that neither nanr nor GeneReg	 requires the wild - type segment of d7 dna in order to be able to activate RegProtein expression .

the results of this analysis confirm this assertion , and show additionally that GeneReg	 is also better able to we previously presented evidence suggesting that the d2 region , and hence nanr and nagc , could activate RegProtein expression by blocking the inhibitory effect of additional cis - acting element ( s ) positioned closer to fimb ( el - labany et al . , 2003 ) .

nanr and GeneReg	 activate RegProtein expression by binding to operator sequences ( o nr and o nc1 respectively ; fig . 1 ) situated further upstream of the regulated promoter than is usual in bacteria . 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

by replacing the 274 bp of wild - type dna from - 467 to - 194 with heterologous sequences it was shown that neither nanr nor GeneReg	 requires this segment of dna in order to activate RegProtein expression .

taking these results together with those presented above , it is concluded that the cooperative interaction of GeneReg	 bound to o nc1 and o nc2 , with ihf bound to the site identified in this work , forms a nucleoprotein complex that activates RegProtein expression .

considered together , these data show that ihf promotes an interaction between GeneReg	 bound to o nc1 and o nc 2 , forming a stable nucleoprotein complex that activates RegProtein expression .

to test this hypothesis further , and to examine the effect of operator - to - promoter distance on GeneReg	 activation , the effect of deleting the 274 bp region ( d7 ) described above on RegProtein expression was also analysed ( fig . 8 ) .

taken together , these results support a model in which o nc2 enhances the binding of GeneReg	 to o nc1 , with the two sites functioning jointly to control RegProtein expression .

the expression of both fusions was increased by growth on galactose and to a lesser extent by growth on glcnac , supporting the hypothesis that GeneReg	 is involved in repression of RegProtein ( table 2 ) .

although a similar arrangement of sites around the transcription initiation regions of other genes of the gal regulon might have suggested that they all are regulated by a similar mechanism to gale ( weickert and adhya , 1993a , b ; semsey et al . , 2007 ) , the results presented in this paper demonstrate that repression of the RegProtein gene	 , is mediated by a distinctly different nucleoprotein complex involving nagc as well as GeneReg and galr and including at least 280 bp of dna .

there are two GeneReg operator sites	 upstream of gimu the perfect inverse correlation between the induction of nag and repression of RegProtein genes posed the question as to whether the regulation of glm genes expression involved the glmu .

although the proximal site , boxgl , is located at a position typical of prokaryotic activators ( collado - vides et al . , 1991 ; gralla , 1991 ) , it is not sufficient to allow GeneReg	 to to activate RegProtein by itself ; this could be because glmu occupation of this lower affinity site is inadequate in the absence of the higher affinity upstream site .

GeneReg	 is best characterized as a repressor ( plumbridge , 2001 ; plumbridge and pellegrini , 2004 ) , although the regulator does activate one of the RegProtein operon promoters albeit by binding at the more conventional position of - 47 relative to the transcriptional start site ( plumbridge , 1995 ) .

the RegProtein operon	 , which is regulated positively by nagc , also relies upon co - operative binding of GeneReg to two sites ( 2 ) . 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O 

compared with other operons regulated by GeneReg	 , nage - bacd and RegProtein , it is very likely that the repression complex involves an interaction between glmus bound to its two sites , nagc and nagc , so that a dna loop is formed .

the simultaneous binding of repressor and activator type proteins to RegProtein dna	 implies two corollaries : ( 1 ) nagc does not repress by competition with GeneReg and ( 2 ) cap does not activate by displacing cap .

the preferential repression by GeneReg	 at the looped RegProtein – lacz fusion , compared with nagbe – lac lacz fusion with a single operator site , emphasises that the nage – nagc is normally dependent upon dna loop formation involving the higher the nage –	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

GeneReg	 represses RegProtein - acetylgl - specific transporter , encoding the nucosamine , while nage - acetylgl - specific transporter represses three mlc s , mlc , pts operon and pts operon , involved in the uptake of glucose .

however the much stronger repression of this fusion by overproduced mlc , compared with overproduced GeneReg	 , shows that the isolated RegProtein operator site has a higher affinity for nage operator site than mlc .

in contrast , ihf does not enhance the ability of GeneReg	 to activate RegProtein expression in the wild - type background . 	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O 

however , placing the GeneReg	 , ihf and nagc sites binding closer to the RegProtein promoter enhances the ability of the regulators to activate fimb promoter expression . 	O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

this suggests that ihf binding to ibs has a small inhibitory effect on the ability of GeneReg	 to activate RegProtein expression . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

thus , GeneReg	 and nagc appear to activate RegProtein expression independently 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

thus the d3 region is not apparently required for GeneReg	 to activate RegProtein expression in the wildtype background , and it could contain specific sequences that inhibit this . 	O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

while the basis for this effect is uncertain , it is nevertheless evident that neither GeneReg	 nor nagc requires the wild - type segment of d7 dna in order to be able to activate RegProtein expression . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

the results of this analysis confirm this assertion , and show additionally that nagc is also better able to we previously presented evidence suggesting that the d2 region , and hence GeneReg	 and nagc , could activate RegProtein expression by blocking the inhibitory effect of additional cis - acting element ( s ) positioned closer to fimb ( el - labany et al . , 2003 ) . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

GeneReg	 and nagc activate RegProtein expression by binding to operator sequences ( o nr and o nc1 respectively ; fig . 1 ) situated further upstream of the regulated promoter than is usual in bacteria . 	O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the results described above also suggest that when o nr is placed closer to the RegProtein promoter	 , nanr is better able to activate GeneReg expression , and further work supports this idea . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O 

by replacing the 274 bp of wild - type dna from - 467 to - 194 with heterologous sequences it was shown that neither GeneReg	 nor nagc requires this segment of dna in order to activate RegProtein expression . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

thus , if the model proposed above is correct , it seems probable that GeneReg	 must make contact with rna polymerase , or another regulatory factor bound closer to the promoter , in order to activate RegProtein expression in the wild - type background as well . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O 

discussion we showed in earlier work that RegProtein	 expression , and hence the off - to - on phase switching of type 1 fimb riation , is activated by nanr and GeneReg and hence repressed fig . 9 .

this observation not only allows us to understand how a modest mutation in o nc2 can affect RegProtein	 expression whereas the d3 mutation does not , but it also supports our prior assertion that nanr activates GeneReg expression without fimb ( sohanpal et al . , 2004 ) . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

thus , activation of RegProtein	 expression by nanr , as judged by the effect of mutations in GeneReg , orin its operator sequence ( o nr ) , is enhanced considerably in the d3 deletion mutant .

this is likely due to the greater extent of activation by GeneReg	 of promoters involved in superoxide defense , e . g . , acna , fpr , RegProtein , zwf , and fumc .

despite overlapping regulation by GeneReg	 , mara , and rob , the three systems exhibit differential control in terms of both the strength of their effects on individual genes and activation of some promoters uniquely ( e . g . , RegProtein by zwf or soxs but not by soxs ) .

20 - 22 , 39 indeed , changing c5 to any of the other three nucleotides severely reduces GeneReg	 - dependent transcription activation of the fpr and RegProtein promoters . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O 

for instance , rob has been shown to bind and activate the RegProtein promoter	 in vitro but whole cell zwf regulation cannot be activated by rob , although the gene responds to soxs and GeneReg ( ariza et al . , 1995 ; jair et al . , 1995 1996a ; b ) .

this result again demonstrates that GeneReg	 activation of the RegProtein promoter is dependent on a functional mar promoter ( 27 ) . 	O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the known GeneReg	 - activated genes are soda ( encoding mnsuperoxide dismutase ) , fpr ( nadph - ferred oxin oxidoreductase ) , micf ( anti sen se rna , repressor of ompf translation ) , riba ( cyclic gmp hydrolase ) , inaa ( unknown function ) , flda and fldb ( flavodoxins a b and ) , nfo ( endonuclease iv ) , RegProtein operon ( multiple - antibiotic - resistance ) , marrab operon ( also called nfsa , a nfsa red 	O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

the RegProtein trec operon	 is negatively regulated by trer , whose gene GeneReg is located upstream of trer but is not part of the operon 	O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the transport of glucuronides and their subsequent interconversion to the glucuronate in e . coli is mediated by the genes of the RegProtein operon	 , which is under negative regulation by uidr and GeneReg ( blanco , 1987 ) 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O
