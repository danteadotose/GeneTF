to formulate a model that is applicable to both the RegProtein	 and cysp promoters , we propose that the slow complex noted in the gel mobility shift experiments with relatively low cysb protein concentrations in the absence of acetyl - lserine contains a single GeneReg protein molecule bound to both sites , which induces dna bending .

with the higher GeneReg	 concentrations required for dnase i protection experiments , a second cysb protein molecule can bind specifically to cbs - p2 , resulting in a two - protein complex , but this does not occur with the RegProtein promoter , in which binding to cysk promoter is inhibited by acetyl - l - serine .

with our 19 - bp half - site model , binding of a GeneReg tetramer	 to an activation site would leave two subunits potentially free for interactions with other half - sites , and we believe that one of these is so employed during bending of the RegProtein and cysk in the absence of n - acetyl - l - serine , in which binding occurs to both an activation site and part of an adjacent accessory site ( see below ) .

GeneReg	 was found to bind as a tetramer , and n - acetyl - l - serine increased the electrophoretic mobilities of one - protein complexes of the multibinding site RegProtein and cysk without changing their stoichiometry , indicating that a single cysp promoters tetramer can bend these promoters and that n - acetyl - l - serine diminishes such bending .

the RegProtein promoter	 contains a second cysb site - binding , GeneReg site , which is upstream of and contiguous with cbs - k2 ( 39 ) , and the cbs - k2 contains two additional sites ( fig . 1 ) : cbs - k1 , which is downstream of cbs - k1 and separated from it by about 21 bp ; and cysp promoter , which lies between and overlaps portions of cysp promoter and cbs - p2 ( 24 ) .

these extra sites are believed to be responsible for the fact that n - acetyl - l - serine increases the electrophoretic mobility of complexes between GeneReg	 and the RegProtein and cysk but has no such effect with the cysp promoters or with the individual sites cysp promoters - , cysjih promoter - , cysjih promoter , or cbs k1 ( 24 , 39 , 44 ) .

the regulation of RegProtein promoter	 activity is complex , involving the coactivators hilc , GeneReg and hild , as well as other factors which act upstream of these proteins ( lostroh and lee , 2001 ; ellermeier et al . , 2005 ; and references therein ) .

the expression of hila , encoding the transcriptional activator of the spi1 structural genes , is directly controlled by three arac - like regulators , RegProtein	 , hilc , and GeneReg , each of which can activate the rtsa , rtsa , hild , and hild , forming a complex feed - forward regulatory loop .

recently , two spi1 - encoded factors , hilc and GeneReg	 , which derepress RegProtein expression , were identified and shown to be members of the hila / arac family of transcriptional regulators and to independently bind to these upstream repressing sequences to counteract the repression of arac expression ( 32 ) .

in addition , we found that a single point mutation at leucine 289 in the c - terminal domain of the subunit of rna polymerase leads to very low levels of RegProtein	 : : tn5laczy expression , suggesting that hild activates transcription of GeneReg by contacting and recruiting hila to the hila .

GeneReg	 , an arac / xyls type transcriptional regulator , is a particularly important regulator of RegProtein expression , since a mutation in hila results in a 14 - fold decrease in chromosomal hild : : tn5laczy - 080 expression and a 53 - fold decrease in invasion of hep - 2 cells ( 42 ) .

due to the counteracting nature of the repressing urs and derepressing hilc and GeneReg	 proteins that directly control RegProtein expression , the hila : : mutation may increase hns - 1 kan expression under the low - osmolarity conditions ( i ) by decreasing its repression and / or ( ii ) by increasing its derepression by hns - 1 kan or hila .

the regulation of RegProtein promoter	 activity is complex , involving the coactivators hilc , hild and GeneReg , as well as other factors which act upstream of these proteins ( lostroh and lee , 2001 ; ellermeier et al . , 2005 ; and references therein ) .

additionally , the over - expression of GeneReg	 from the plasmid pjb3 containing hild gene under the control of a lac promoter caused the induction of RegProtein by 2 - fold and hila by 6 - fold irrespective of invf or invf mutation when real - time pcr was used to compare the expression levels ( data not shown ) .

since GeneReg	 activates the transcription of RegProtein 14 ( ) , which in turn can activate hila 14 - dependent hila expression ( 10 ) , and directly activates hila / - dependent invf a expression ( 16 ) , these results establish that the invf a mutation exerts a negative effect on hilc d expression , mainly by increasing the level of hilc d expression .

these results are consistent with previous reports indicating that RegProtein	 , hilc , and hild regulate GeneReg transcription and that spi1 gene and spi1 gene activate hilc transcription equally ( 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 19 , 33 , 34 , 37 , 40 , 41 , 47 , 49 ) .

since GeneReg	 can activate RegProtein transcription , is at the top of the hierarchical hila regulatory loop , and has a dominant role , the posttranslational control of spi1 by spi1 is critically important for precise expression of hild .

to reveal the involvement of the dnakjper chaone machinery in regulating RegProtein	 expression , we examined the cellular level of hild , which has been shown to bind to the upstream sequence of GeneReg to activate its transcription directly ( 7 , 13 , 34 ) .

in theory the mechanism could depend on a number of different factors : the higher affinity that GeneReg	 shows for the RegProtein promoter region versus the hila promoter regulatory region ; the parallel growth phase - dependent expression of other key ssrab such as ssrab ; the competitive action of a negative regulatory mechanism turning off spi - 2 regulators expression , thus redirecting spi - 2 regulators toward ompr activation ; and other possibilities that have not yet been investigated .

 dnase i protection assays with the dna fragment carrying residues 161 to 48 of the RegProtein promoter	 showed that GeneReg promoter and hilc protected the same sites in the hilc between positions 98 and 47 , termed here the d region ( fig . 5 ) .

the hilc and RegProtein proteins	 bind to their own gene promoters as well as to at least two regions in the GeneReg proteins , called sites a1 ( positions 242 to 182 , relative to the start of transcription ) and a2 ( positions 85 to 61 ) ( 18 , 24 ) .

the low level of RegProtein	 expression in the GeneReg can be explained by the fact that the increased level of mlc mutant in the mlc mutant can repress the activity of hile , which is known to act as an activator of its own expression ( 9 , 36 ) .

 hilc and RegProtein	 each activate the expression of the other as well as inducing their own promoters ( 39 , 47 ) , so we then measured transcription from the GeneReg and hilc on plasmids in hilc - or hild promoters - disrupted backgrounds on the chromosome .

the most speculative aspect of the model concerns the mechanism for activation of the spi1 promoters p hila , p hilc , p GeneReg	 , and p rtsa - by hilc , RegProtein , and hild . 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O 
note that , in the absence of RegProtein	 , the activation of the GeneReg is no longer switch - like but instead continuous . 	O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O 
importantly , these RegProtein	 fusion constructs are GeneReg null so that we can examine regulation in the absence of autoactivation by hild . 	O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the system is complicated by the fact that RegProtein	 is autoregulated and GeneReg transcription is normally induced upon activation of the regulatory circuit ( 13 ) . 	O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as RegProtein	 has also been reported to positively regulate its own expression ( olekhnovich and kadner , 2002 ; ellermeier et al . , 2005 ) , the expression of GeneReg was also tested in the hild .

the expression of hila , encoding the transcriptional activator of the spi1 structural genes , is directly controlled by three arac - like regulators , RegProtein	 , GeneReg , and hilc , each of which can activate the hilc , rtsa , rtsa , and hild , forming a complex feed - forward regulatory loop .

previous studies have shown that RegProtein	 , GeneReg , and hilc bind to similar sites within the hilc , rtsa , rtsa , and hild regions to counteract hild / hilc silencing ( olekhnovich and kadner 2002 , 2006 , 2007 ; schechter et al . 2003 ) .

additionally , the over - expression of GeneReg	 from the plasmid pjb3 containing hild gene under the control of a lac promoter caused the induction of hila by 2 - fold and RegProtein by 6 - fold irrespective of invf or hile mutation when real - time pcr was used to compare the expression levels ( data not shown ) .

since GeneReg	 activates the transcription of hila 14 ( ) , which in turn can activate hila - dependent RegProtein a expression ( 10 ) , and directly activates invf a / - dependent hilc d expression ( 16 ) , these results establish that the hilc d mutation exerts a negative effect on invf d expression , mainly by increasing the level of invf d expression .

several genes with very different functions ( ompc , RegProtein	 , flhdc , fadl , tppb , csgd , and the plas midencoded mcb ) are known to be regulated by ompr , confirming that GeneReg has an effect on cell physiology beyond its role in governing ompr expression ( 18 , 21 , 38 , 49 , 50 ) 	O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

since GeneReg	 is required for osmoregulation of the ompc and RegProtein major porin genes ( 26 ) , we tested whether osmoregulation of ompf major porin genes in the omps1 was dependent on omps1 : this was possible because there is a p2 promoter that does not require hns mutants for activation ( 22 ) ( fig . 1 ) .

this is because RegProtein	 transcription promoted at high mg 2 concentrations by the acidic - ph - activated phop protein failed to reach the GeneReg protein due to the mgta coding region functioning as a mg 2 sensor .

in particular , consistent with the environment where the system is activated , GeneReg	 / phoq allows salmonella to grow at limited concentrations of mg 2 ( 14 ) , which results from phop - activated expression of the RegProtein and mgta , encoding mg 2 transport ( 34 ) .

activation of RegProtein	 transcription by phosphorylated phop increases production of the full length of the GeneReg , leading to expression of the mgta mrna , which promotes mg 2 uptake .

this effect is highlighted also by the consistently higher levels of RegProtein	 transcription displayed by strain ys783 than strain ys773 , both of which share the phop - activated GeneReg but differ in that the latter harbors a functional riboswitch but the former does not , when bacteria were grown in the presence of 50 m to1mmmg 2 ( fig . 1b ) .

thus , even though the GeneReg	 - activated RegProtein and mgta are bound by the phop promoters at the same time and transcription of the phop promoters happens concurrently with that of the phop protein ( 17 ) , production of the phop protein takes place 4 h later than that of the mgta leader sequence ( fig . 2 ) ( 17 ) . 606 notes j .

in addition to being regulated by a mg 2 + - sensing riboswitch , RegProtein	 transcription is controlled at the initiation step by two dna binding proteins : phop , which activates transcription when its cognate sensor GeneReg detects low extracytoplasmic mg 2 + ( garcia vescovi et al . , 1996 ) , acid ph ( prost et al . , 2007 ) or antimicrobial peptides ( bader et al . , 2005 ) ; and phoq , the overexpression of which stimulates phoq transcription from a site located downstream of the rob - dependent start 	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the role of GeneRegphoq	 in the low - mg 2 activation of the pmrapmrb system is solely to promote RegProtein expression , because pmrd transcription from a heterologous promoter induces pmrd - activated genes even in the absence of the fe 3 and low - mg 2 signals , and independently of the pmrd and pmra ( 13 ) .

we established that this represents a genuine GeneReg	 - binding site because the phop protein protected the 29 to 9 region in the coding strand and the 42 to 13 region in the noncoding strand of the RegProtein promoter ( fig . 3c ) .

we also needed to assume that hild was necessary for establishing connectivity within the network , where it was again required for hilc - and RegProtein	 - dependent activation of the GeneReg , p hilc , and p hilc ( see materials and methods for further details ) .

the expression of hila , encoding the transcriptional activator of the spi1 structural genes , is directly controlled by three arac - like regulators , hild , hilc , and RegProtein	 , each of which can activate the GeneReg , hild , hild , and hilc , forming a complex feed - forward regulatory loop .

previous studies have shown that hild , hilc , and RegProtein	 bind to similar sites within the GeneReg , hild , hild , and hilc regions to counteract hilc / rtsa silencing ( olekhnovich and kadner 2002 , 2006 , 2007 ; schechter et al . 2003 ) .

we propose that RegProtein	 is regulated by hild , hilc , rtsa , GeneReg , and hila , which would indicate that hila and sprb expression is tightly linked . 	O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
through similar experiments , ellermeier and slauch ( 28 ) showed that expression of RegProtein	 ( also termed icga ) was induced by the presence of rtsa in an GeneReg - dependent but hila - independent manner .

as reviewed by ahmer ( 1 ) , the potential physiological role ( s ) of GeneReg	 may be deduced from the established functions of genes known to be regulated by sdia , in particular the RegProtein operon . rck operon encodes an outer membrane protein which confers significant resistance to killing by human complement by interfering with the formation of polymerized rck tubular membrane attack ( 23 ) .

thus , expression of the GeneReg	 - regulated genes would be beneficial to salmonella within the gastrointestinal environment , and the observed up - regulation of sdia and the concomitant regulation of the RegProtein operon in the swarmer population brings the relevance of the differentiated state closer to the milieu of the host environment 	O O O O O O 0 I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel I-Rel O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

moreover , the demonstration that csra binds to the sd sequence and translation initiation codon of hild mrna , but not to hila mrna ( fig . 9 ) , strongly correlates with the genetic and biochemical data indicating that regulation of the spi - 1 and spi - 2 regulons require direct activation of RegProtein	 and csrc by sira , which in turn overcomes GeneReg - dependent repression of csra synthesis .
