The results of the present study extend these observations and show that the <font color='blue'>MetR_protein</font> **also stimulates the in vitro expression of metH and that both the MetE and** <font color='blue'>MetH_proteins</font> synthesized in vitro are enzymatically active .  

Operons observed to be differentially expressed include not only all four of the transcripts , hmpA , ytfE , <font color='blue'>ygbA</font> **, and hcp - hcr , known or predicted to be** <font color='blue'>NsrR</font> - regulated ( 4 , 40 ) , but also other transcripts predicted to be regulated by nitrite or RNS generated from nitrite , for example , nitric oxide ( 11 ) .  

Identification of the DNAbinding domain of the <font color='blue'>OmpR_protein</font> **required for transcriptional activation of the ompF and** <font color='blue'>ompC_genes</font> of Escherichia coli by in vivo DNA footprinting .  

 <font color='blue'>MelR</font> **is a member of the AraC - XylS family of bacterial gene regulatory proteins ( 6 ) and our previous studies have shown that MelR , together with the cyclic AMP receptor protein , CRP , regulates expression of the** <font color='blue'>melAB_operon</font> that encodes products essential for melibiose metabolism ( 7 ) .  

For example , the nitrate reductase genes <font color='blue'>narGHJI</font> **are regulated exclusively by NarL and are not responsive to NarP as observed here for cydD , while nitrate induction of the fdnGHI operon is regulated predominantly by** <font color='blue'>NarL</font> but is also responsive in part to NarP ( 33 , 39 ) .  

Under identical experimental conditions as for <font color='blue'>argO</font> **, the regulatory regions of the other ArgP - regulated genes ( asd , dapB , dapD , gdhA , lysA , lysC , and lysP ) were also bound by ArgP , with apparent K d s ranging from 55 nM to 170 nM ; in all these cases ( unlike the situation with argO ) , the addition of** <font color='blue'>Lys</font> was associated with an increase in the apparent K d , indicating that ArgP binding in these instances is Lys sensitive .  

 <font color='blue'>MelR</font> **- dependent repression of the** <font color='blue'>melR_promoter</font> in each of the new constructs was measured as above and the results are illustrated in Figure 6B .  

Given that the activation by full - length , chromosomally expressed <font color='blue'>RhaS</font> **at rhaBAD is approximately 33 - fold higher than that of chromosomally expressed RhaR at rhaSR , comparable efficiencies of activation by the CTDs to their full - length counterparts would have resulted in His 6 - RhaR -** <font color='blue'>CTD</font> activating rhaSR by approximately 30 - fold .  

This observation not only allows us to understand how a modest mutation in O NC2 can affect <font color='blue'>fimB</font> **expression whereas the D3 mutation does not , but it also supports our prior assertion that NanR activates fimB expression without** <font color='blue'>NagC</font> ( Sohanpal et al . , 2004 ) .  

These latter results , together with the experiments described here showing that <font color='blue'>MetJ</font> **binds to this region of DNA , strongly suggest that the - 8 to + 27 region is involved in** <font color='blue'>metE</font> repression .  

Note that in a control experiment , the activity of the MBP - <font color='blue'>NarL</font> **protein was confirmed by its ability to activate transcription of the NarL - dependent** <font color='blue'>fdnG_promoter</font> in vitro ( data not shown ) .  

Thus , it appears that NarL and <font color='blue'>NarP</font> **adopt overlapping mechanisms to inhibit**  adopt overlapping mechanisms to inhibit ydhY – T expression .  

In relation to pacsP1 , the DNA site for <font color='blue'>Fis</font> **is centred at position – 61 , and its distal nature suggests that** <font color='blue'>pacsP1</font> repression operates via a different mechanism .  

Our results indicate that yggA encodes an <font color='blue'>ArgP</font> **- regulated** <font color='blue'>Arg_exporter</font> in E . coli .  

Organization and regulation of the <font color='blue'>D_-_xylose_operons</font> **in Escherichia coli K - 12 :** <font color='blue'>XylR</font> acts as a transcriptional activator .  

Some of these operons are regulated by the <font color='blue'>NarL_protein</font> **alone , such as the narG and frdA operons , whereas expression of the nirB ( encoding NADH - dependent nitrite reductase ) , nrfA and fdnG operons is controlled by both the** <font color='blue'>NarL</font> and NarP proteins .  

The <font color='blue'>ArgP_protein</font> **enhances the expression of the argK gene To test the biological activity of the** <font color='blue'>ArgP_protein</font> on the arginine transport system , the amounts of mRNA synthesized by a 502 bp KpnI - EcoRV DNA fragment containing the N terminus and the control region of the argK gene was investigated .  

However , the inactivation of DcuS ( <font color='blue'>IMW553</font> **) led to a decrease of citC - lacZ expression by a factor of 1 . 5 , which could be due to interaction between CitA and** <font color='blue'>DcuS</font> .  

RESULTS Oligomerization of DnaA Protein to the <font color='blue'>dnaA_Promoter</font> **— Sequence - specific DNA binding of DnaA protein to the** <font color='blue'>dnaA_promoter_region</font> ( Fig . 1 ) was studied in detail using a combined gel - shift and chemical footprinting assay to determine the extent of DNA binding to the region flanking the consensus DNA - binding site , the DnaA box .
