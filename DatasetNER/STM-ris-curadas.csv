17933888,212,BaeR,mdtABC,An electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the purified BaeR - His 6 protein showed binding to the regions upstream of the mdt operon and acrD ( Fig . 2B ) .,
17933888,214,BaeR,mdtABC,These results indicate that the mdtABC and acrD drug efflux genes are directly regulated by BaeR protein ( Fig . 2C ) .,
17933888,252,BaeR,mdtABC,"DISCUSSION In this study , we performed a genome - wide search for a regulator of multidrug resistance in S . enterica serovar Typhimurium by random shotgun cloning and discovered BaeR , which upregulates the mdtABCD locus and acrD , thereby increasing resistance to - lactams , novobiocin , and deoxycholate .",
17933888,267,BaeR,mdtABC,"In the present study , we found that overexpression of BaeR strongly stimulates the expression of mdtABCD and acrD in Salmonella .",
17933888,278,BaeR,mdtABC,"Both AcrD and MdtABC are required for the Salmonella multidrug resistance induced by BaeR ( Table 3 ) , indicating that this resistance is due to the increased expression of acrD and mdtABC .",

23918818,39,BaeR,sodA,"Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) , transcriptional fusions , and mutation of the sodA promoter region , we show that BaeR exerts its regulation by direct interaction with one of the predicted sites .",

23918818,157,BaeR,sodA,"This indicates that BBS - 1 and BBS - 2 are required for BaeR - P binding in vitro , and suggests that they are required for the observed regulation of sodA expression .",
23918818,164,BaeR,sodA,"In sum , the results from EMSAs and transcriptional fusions indicate that BaeR positively regulates sodA in response to CIP by a direct interaction with its promoter region , most likely by binding to BBS - 1 . http : / / mic . sgmjournals . org 2053P .",
23918818,205,BaeR,sodA,"Supporting this hypothesis , Martin et al . ( 2008 ) demonstrated that SoxS is activated at high concentrations of O 2 2 2 , while CIP is suggested to generate low levels of O 2 ( Goswami et al . , 2006 ) , and therefore sodA upregulation by SoxS and / or BaeR could be dose dependent .",

7896708,6,MetR,metE,"In this study , we show that purified MetR protein also binds to and protects a second 24 - bp sequence adjacent to the original site , from nucleotides 24 to 47 relative to the metE transcription initiation site ( designated as site 2 ) .",
7896708,8,MetR,metE,"Base pair changes in site 1 or site 2 away from the MetR consensus binding sequence resulted in decreased metE - lacZ expression , suggesting that both sites are necessary for expression .",

7896708,14,MetR,metE,"The pathway intermediate homocysteine serves as a coregulator for MetR - mediated regulation of these genes and has a negative effect on metA and metH expression ( 4 , 12 , 28 ) and a positive effect on metE and metF expression ( 4 , 6 , 28 ) .",
7896708,18,MetR,metE,Previous genetic and biochemical data identified a binding site for MetR protein in the metE metR regulatory region ( site 1 in Fig . 1 ) that is necessary for MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene ( 27 ) .,
7896708,19,MetR,metE,"We show here that a second MetR - binding site , with a lower affinity for MetR protein than that of site 1 , is located adjacent to site 1 and is also required for MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene ( designated as site 2 in Fig . 1 ) .",
7896708,20,MetR,metE,A possible model for these two binding sites in MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene is discussed .,
7896708,76,MetR,metE,RESULTS Identification of a second MetR - binding site for metE .,
7896708,80,MetR,metE,"At a low concentration ( 7 nM dimer ) , the MetR protein protected a region from approximately positions 48 to 71 upstream of the metE transcription initiation site ( site 1 in Fig . 2 ) .",
7896708,86,MetR,metE,"To determine whether site 2 is functionally important in MetRmediated activation of the metE gene , mutations were constructed in site 2 either toward or away from the MetR consensus sequence .",
7896708,123,MetR,metE,"The - galactosidase level in lysogen 762 ElacRuid - a3 , however , was decreased twofold compared with that in the control 762ElacRuid lysogen , and the nucleotide changes may have a small effect on the metE promoter as well as on MetR - mediated activation .",
7896708,161,MetR,metE,An in vitro DNase I footprinting assay was performed with the parental and a1 mutant DNAs as templates to determine whether the MetR - dependent residual metE - lacZ expression in the site 1 mutant was dependent on MetR bound at site 2 alone or whether residual binding of MetR at site 1 also occurs ( Fig . 3B ) .,
7896708,162,MetR,metE,"Site 1 of the mutant DNA was not protected from DNase I digestion at any concentration of MetR tested , suggesting that the metE - lacZ expression observed in the a1 mutant is due to MetR protein bound solely to site 2 .",
7896708,175,MetR,metE,"To show that the high levels of metE - lacZ expression in the a1 , 2 double mutant are due to MetR - mediated activation rather than the result of promoter - up mutations , the mutant phage was used to lysogenize the metR strain GS762 .",
7896708,183,MetR,metE,Previous results showed that mutations in site 1 decreased MetR - mediated activation of metE - lacZ expression ( 27 ) .,
7896708,184,MetR,metE,The data presented here demonstrate that mutations in either site 1 or site 2 away from the consensus sequence decrease MetR - mediated activation of metE - lacZ expression ( Table 1 ) .,
7896708,189,MetR,metE,"Thus , MetR protein bound at site 1 alone is probably not sufficient for metE - lacZ expression .",
7896708,192,MetR,metE,"Thus , residual MetR - mediated activation of the metE - lacZ fusion in this lysogen is probably due to MetR bound exclusively at the wild - type site 2 .",
7896708,194,MetR,metE,"The structure of the metE promoter region proposed here , in which a high - affinity MetR - binding site enhances binding of MetR at a low - affinity promoter - proximal activation site , is similar to the arrangement found in many of the promoters whose transcription is activated by LysR - type regulators .",
7896708,196,MetR,metE,"It is interesting that when site 2 in the metE promoter is changed to a consensus MetR - binding site , metE - lacZ expression is not only independent of a functional site 1 but also essentially independent of the coactivator homocysteine both in vivo ( Tables 1 and 3 ) and in vitro ( Fig . 4 ) .",
7896708,198,MetR,metE,"Arranging site 2 as a nonconsensus site , while making MetR - mediated activation of metE homocysteine dependent , also decreases the affinity of site 2 for MetR .",

7896708,119,MetR,metEmetR,"Therefore , loss of metE - lacZ expression in lysogens carrying mutation a3 is probably due to the inability of MetR bound at site 1 alone to activate the metE - lacZ fusion , indicating that site 2 in the metE metR regulatory region is necessary for normal metE - lacZ expression .",
7896708,180,MetR,metEmetR,DISCUSSION The data presented above demonstrate the presence of two MetR - binding sites in the metE metR regulatory region of S . typhimurium .,

8376333,103,MetR,metF,"This hypothesis would predict that in a metJ mutant , in which all MetJ - mediated repression is abolished , MetR would have no function in metF - lacZ expression .",

8376333,107,MetR,metF,Mutations that changed each of the three MetR - binding sites individually away from the MetR consensus binding sequence were introduced into the metF control region ( see Materials and Methods and Fig . 1 ) .,
8376333,119,MetR,metF,These results suggest that the mutations are specifically affecting a MetR - dependent mechanism and that all three MetR - binding sites identified by DNase I footprinting are necessary for normal metF - lacZ expression .,
8376333,120,MetR,metF,DISCUSSION A computer search of the S . typhimurium metF sequence identified three possible MetR - binding sites ( Fig . 1 ) .,

12676988,174,PhoP,mgtA,"Although in vitro transcription of the PhoP - activated mgtA gene does not require - CTD ( 27 ) , PmrA binding to the pmrD promoter may hinder - CTD in vivo .",
15516559,120,PhoP,mgtA,The mgtA and pbgP genes are paradigm genes for the two types of regulation reported for the PhoP - PhoQ system .,
15516559,121,PhoP,mgtA,"In a low - Mg 2 environment , mgtA is regulated directly by PhoP , whereas pbgP is regulated by PhoP - PhoQ via the PmrA regulatory protein ( 18 ) .",
18487336,28,PhoP,mgtA,"It has been previously demonstrated that mgtA expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the extracellular Mg 2 - responsive PhoP / PhoQ two - component system ( 13 , 39 ) and posttranscriptionally by an intracellular Mg 2 - sensitive riboswitch that governs the extent of transcript elongation and stability ( 9 , 40 ) .",
18487336,31,PhoP,mgtA,"Additionally , mgtA transcription is differentially and more sensitively regulated in response to environmental Mg 2 availability compared to other PhoP - regulated genes , with its promoter displaying a higher affinity for the PhoP regulator ( 31 , 40 ) .",
18487336,96,PhoP,mgtA,RESULTS mgtA expression is specifically upregulated by Rob in a PhoP - independent manner .,
18487336,170,PhoP,mgtA,"Interestingly , the resultant Rob - dependent mgtA transcript is distinct and independent of that induced by the PhoP regulatory activity .",

18676664,121,PhoP,mgtA,"However , mgtA and mgtCB expression can be markedly induced via the PhoP / PhoQ two - component system upon response to certain external stimuli such as acid , a low Mg 2 concentration , and antimicrobial peptides ( 2 , 26 , 43 ) .",
18676664,125,PhoP,mgtA,"Thus , it is unclear whether induction of the expression of mgtA and mgtCB in a corA mutant strain is mediated by PhoP / PhoQ or another mechanism .",
18676666,25,PhoP,mgtA,"mgtA and mgtB , which encode two inducible Mg 2 transport systems , are also PhoP / PhoQ regulated ( 5 , 32 , 34 ) .",
19801407,12,PhoP,mgtA,This is because mgtA transcription promoted at high Mg 2 concentrations by the acidic - pH - activated PhoP protein failed to reach the mgtA coding region due to the mgtA leader region functioning as a Mg 2 sensor .,
19801407,19,PhoP,mgtA,"In particular , consistent with the environment where the system is activated , PhoP / PhoQ allows Salmonella to grow at limited concentrations of Mg 2 ( 14 ) , which results from PhoP - activated expression of the mgtA and mgtB genes , encoding Mg 2 transporters ( 34 ) .",
19801407,69,PhoP,mgtA,"Activation of mgtA transcription by phosphorylated PhoP increases production of the full length of the mgtA mRNA , leading to expression of the MgtA protein , which promotes Mg 2 uptake .",
19801407,197,PhoP,mgtA,The mRNA leader sequence allows expression of the mgtA gene only when the PhoP / PhoQ system is activated at low Mg 2 .,
19801407,199,PhoP,mgtA,"To explore this possibility , we examined transcription of the Mg 2 transporter mgtA gene , which is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 ) .",
19801407,201,PhoP,mgtA,Why is mgtA not being fully expressed despite the acidic - pH activation of the PhoP protein ?,
19801407,262,PhoP,mgtA,"The corA gene is constitutively expressed ( 8 ) , whereas transcription of the mgtA and mgtB genes is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 , 43 ) .",
19897653,46,PhoP,mgtA,"This effect is highlighted also by the consistently higher levels of mgtA transcription displayed by strain YS783 than strain YS773 , both of which share the PhoP - activated mgtA promoter but differ in that the latter harbors a functional riboswitch but the former does not , when bacteria were grown in the presence of 50 M to1mMMg 2 ( Fig . 1B ) .",
19897653,60,PhoP,mgtA,"Thus , even though the PhoP - activated mgtA and phoP promoters are bound by the PhoP protein at the same time and transcription of the mgtA leader sequence happens concurrently with that of the phoP gene ( 17 ) , production of the MgtA protein takes place 4 h later than that of the PhoP protein ( Fig . 2 ) ( 17 ) . 606 NOTES J .",
19897653,76,PhoP,mgtA,"The mgtA expression behavior is in contrast to that of the Fe 2 transporter gene feoB , which is turned on via the PhoP - activated RstA protein when Salmonella faces acid pH but not in response to low Mg 2 ( 4 ) .",
20041203,59,PhoP,mgtA,"Deletion of mgrB in fluorescent transcriptional reporter strains for three other PhoP - regulated promoters , P mgtA , P phoPQ , and P hemL , resulted in similar increases in fluorescence ( Figure 1C and 1D , and data not shown ) , suggesting that the effect of the deletion is likely to be at a point upstream in the pathway common to all of these genes , i . e . at some point in PhoQ / PhoP signaling .",
20041203,156,PhoP,mgtA,"The four PhoP - regulated promoters that we tested ( promoters for mgrB , phoPQ , mgtA , and hemL ) show at least some level of magnesium responsiveness in an mgrB 2 strain ( Figure 1B1D and data not shown ) .",

21399613,231,PhoP,mgtA,"It is shown that when the 5 0 LR is located in its native chromosomal location , it appears to have an additional regulatory function because the C98T substitution in the 5 0 LR unexpectedly led to constitutive mgtA transcription even in high Mg 2 ( OConnor et al , 2009 ) , in which the transcription initiation is supposed to be repressed by the PhoP / PhoQ system .",

12676988,13,PhoP,pmrD,"The role of PhoPPhoQ in the low - Mg 2 activation of the PmrAPmrB system is solely to promote pmrD expression , because pmrD transcription from a heterologous promoter induces PmrA - activated genes even in the absence of the Fe 3 and low - Mg 2 signals , and independently of the PhoP and PhoQ proteins ( 13 ) .",
