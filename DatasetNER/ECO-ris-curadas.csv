21097628,93,MarA,acnA,,activated,"In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

21097628,93,MarA,fpr,,activated,"In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA .

Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."
21097628,93,MarA,fumC,,activation,"In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter .

In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes .

If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

21097628,93,MarA,micF,,activation,"In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters .

For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

21097628,93,MarA,sodA,,activation,"In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) .

It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) .

In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 µM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the ß - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone ."

9393706,130,MarA,,mar,stimulated,"In a similar experiment with a rob + mar strain , excess MarA stimulated mar transcription of a wild - type mar : : lacZ fusion by only 1.6 - fold ( 27 ) ."
9393706,140,MarA,,mar promoter,activates,We previously demonstrated that in vitro transcriptional activation by MarA at the zwf promoter requires interaction with the carboxy - terminal domain of the a subunit of RNA polymerase ( 21 ) and inferred that MarA activates the mar promoter by enhancing the binding of RNA polymerase ( 27 ) .
21097628,93,MarA,,marRAB,activated,"In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for ß - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA .

17238917,187,NagC,,fimB,activate,NanR and NagC activate fimB expression by binding to operator sequences ( O NR and O NC1 respectively ; Fig . 1 ) situated further upstream of the regulated promoter than is usual in bacteria .
17238917,216,NagC,,fimB,activate,By replacing the 274 bp of wild - type DNA from - 467 to - 194 with heterologous sequences it was shown that neither NanR nor NagC requires this segment of DNA in order to activate fimB expression .

11139621,190,NagC,,nagBE,repression,"The preferential repression by NagC at the looped nagBE – lacZ fusion , compared with the nagE – lacZ fusion with a single operator site , emphasises that regulation by NagC is normally dependent upon DNA loop formation involving the higher - affinity nagB operator ."
